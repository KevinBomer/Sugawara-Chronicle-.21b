I'm sorry, but an uncaught exception occurred.

While running game code:
  File "game/Chapter3somethingAboutAClub.rpy", line 397, in script
    "Though at least a few of those on the list just want to be a fly on the wall for whatever happens between those two. Sheesh."
Exception: Sayer 'Maya' is not defined.
